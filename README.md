django-intro
============

This is a introduction to django - your first django web app!

Follow the instructions carefully. And always use virtual environment while working on django.


This afternoon, we hopefully are going to launch this to the World Wide Web
using heroku!

As always, if there are any questions _please_ ask Jovana or Me.

Good Luck and happy djangoing!


Oh - remember to add the `instructors` remote:

`git remote add instructors https://github.com/aiti-ghana-2012/django-intro.git`
